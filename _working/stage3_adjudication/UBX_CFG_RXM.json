In the M9 generation (Extraction 1), this functionality has been abstracted or deprecated, and the manual documentation simply lists the entire 2-byte payload as reserved. Both extractions are correct for their respective hardware generations, though Extraction 2 contains a minor OCR typo ('1pMode' instead of 'lpMode')."
