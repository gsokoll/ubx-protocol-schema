    "reasoning": "UBX-RXM-MEASC12 (and its counterparts MEASC1, MEASC2, MEASC22) are specifically designed to provide blocks of satellite measurement data for u-blox's CloudLocate service. Each 'measurement' for a satellite is encapsulated in a 12-byte block. Extraction 2 correctly captures this repeating structure (N * 12 bytes). Extraction 1 treats the entire payload as an opaque blob (U1[N]), which, while technically representing the same bytes, fails to describe the protocol's structural logic or the meaning of the data blocks. In u-blox interface manuals, even when the data is proprietary, the length is explicitly defined as a multiple of the satellite count (numMeas)."
