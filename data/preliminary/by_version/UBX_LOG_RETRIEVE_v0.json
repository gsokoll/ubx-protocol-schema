If the odometer was enabled at the time a position was logged, then message UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEPOSEXTRA will also be used. The maximum number of entries that can be returned in response to a single UBX-LOG-RETRIEVE message is 256. If more entries than this are required the message will need to be sent multiple times with different startNumbers. The retrieve will be stopped if any UBX-LOG message is received.
