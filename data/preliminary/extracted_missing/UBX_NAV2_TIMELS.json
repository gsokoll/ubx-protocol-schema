  "description": "Information about the upcoming leap second event if one is scheduled.\nNote: Many sources of leap second information provide the week number of a leap second event as an 8-bit unsigned number. For the upcoming leap second events, this can be resolved and displayed in this message. However, for the previous leap second events decoded from these sources, there is an inherent ambiguity of 256 weeks. Therefore, when the time since the previous event is more than 256 weeks, the dateOfLsGpsWn and timeToLsEvent parameters may provide incorrect information.",
