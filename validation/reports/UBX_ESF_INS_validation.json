These additional fields are consistent in type, scale, and unit with how they are defined for the UBX-ESF-MEAS message (0x10 0x02) on page 2 of the same manual. Therefore, the canonical definition accurately reflects the full structure for the stated length, assuming the PDF's table is incomplete. The discrepancy for bitfield0's data type (U4 in PDF vs X4 in canonical) is semantic; the PDF describes it as a bitfield, making X4 the more precise representation.",
