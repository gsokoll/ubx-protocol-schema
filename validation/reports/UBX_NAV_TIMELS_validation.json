The canonical definition correctly fills these remaining 6 bytes with 'dateOfLsGpsDn' (U2 at offset 18), 'reserved1' (U1[3] at offset 20), and 'valid' (X1 at offset 23). This structure precisely accounts for the declared 24-byte payload. While these fields are not explicitly itemized in the PDF's table, their presence is consistent with common u-blox manual patterns for padding and implied flag fields. Therefore, the canonical definition is considered correct and complete for the 24-byte message, with the PDF's table being incomplete for the final 6 bytes of the payload.",
