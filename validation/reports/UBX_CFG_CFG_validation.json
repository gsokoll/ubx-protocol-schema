While the canonical defines these as `X4` (bitfields) but without explicit bitfield members (e.g., `clearAll`), the description 'if any bit is set' in the PDF implies a bitmask. The canonical's `X4` type is consistent with this behavior, even if the bitfield structure isn't fully detailed within the canonical definition itself (which is more a canonical schema completeness observation than a discrepancy with the PDF's content).",
