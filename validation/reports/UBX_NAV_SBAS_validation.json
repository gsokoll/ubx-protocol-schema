Therefore, validation focused primarily on Page 2 for the message structure.\n\nThere's a minor ambiguity in the PDF's 'Length (Bytes): 12 + cnt 12'. Based on the explicit field definitions within the repeated group (svid U1, reserved1 U1, udre U1, svSys U1), each repeated block is 4 bytes. Thus, the total length should be 12 + cnt * 4. The '12' in 'cnt 12' is likely a typo and should be '4' or it refers to the fixed part of the message length.",
