The canonical `flags` field at byte_offset 22, data_type X1, is described as containing `rtcCalib`, `safeBoot`, `jammingState`, and `xtalAbsent`. While the PDF lists 'Flags' at this offset, it does not explicitly define these bits as part of this field within the MON-HW payload table. However, these individual bit definitions (rtcCalib, safeBoot, jammingState, xtalAbsent) are present elsewhere in the manual (on page 2, above the MON-HW2 payload), and their combined bit length fits within an X1 (1-byte) field, making the canonical interpretation plausible and common for u-blox manuals.",
