The canonical definition, which sums up to exactly 36 bytes (2 bytes for mask + 1 byte for dynModel + 33 bytes for subsequent fields), is consistent with being the full 'Legacy' definition. Therefore, the canonical's detailed field breakdown for the 36-byte payload is assumed to be correct, and the PDF table is merely an abbreviated representation for the purpose of highlighting key fields.

The `dynModel` field (byte offset 2, Type U1) also matches in structure and primary description, although the canonical definition does not explicitly include the extensive enum descriptions provided in the PDF for this field. However, the PDF excerpt for UBX-CFG-NAV5 abruptly stops describing payload fields after `dynModel` at byte offset 2, despite indicating a total payload length of 36 bytes. This means the vast majority of the payload fields defined in the canonical JSON (from `fixMode` onwards, covering 33 bytes) are not validated by the provided PDF pages.
