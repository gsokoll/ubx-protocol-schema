      "notes": "Page 1 of the PDF appears to display the structure of a different UBX message (likely UBX-NAV-SAT or similar, identified by fields like 'geo', 'svid', 'prc', 'ic') under the '3.15.17 UBX-NAV-SIG' heading. Therefore, only Page 2 of the PDF was used for validating UBX-NAV-SIG structure. The fixed-size fields (iTOW, version, numSigs, reserved0) in the canonical definition correctly match the PDF on Page 2.",
