      "reasoning": "The byte offset, data type, and the core meaning of the description are identical in both the canonical definition and the PDF manual. The canonical description for 'jamInd' is 'CW jamming indicator/suppression level', which closely matches the PDF's field name 'cwSuppression' and its description 'CW interference suppression level, scaled (0 = no CW jamming, 255 = strong CW jamming)'. The PDF's field name 'cwSuppression' is more specific and descriptive, aligning better with the detailed description of the field's purpose. This is a naming discrepancy that should be resolved by updating the canonical definition to use the more precise name from the official documentation.",
