This is not a discrepancy but could be made more explicit in the canonical. \n2.  **Field Name Case**: The PDF uses 'V' in 'CoV' (e.g., `posCoVNN`), while the canonical uses 'v' in 'Cov' (e.g., `posCovNN`). This is a minor case difference and does not affect the interpretation of the fields. \n3.  **PDF Typo in 'Name' Column**: For `posCovDD` (offset 36) and `velCovDD` (offset 60), the PDF's 'Name' column shows `posCoVPP` and `velCoVPP` respectively. However, the 'Description' column for these fields correctly refers to `p_DD` and `v_DD`, which aligns perfectly with the canonical `posCovDD` and `velCovDD` names and the sequential pattern of covariance matrices (NN, NE, ND, EE, ED, DD). This strongly suggests a typo or OCR error in the PDF's 'Name' column for these specific entries. The canonical definition is considered correct in this regard, while the PDF's 'Name' column is inaccurate.",
