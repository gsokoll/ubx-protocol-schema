Given that 'cnt' represents the 'Number of pseudorange corrections following' and each correction group is 8 bytes, the formula should logically be '20 + cnt * 8'. The canonical definition's `payload.length.variable.base: 20` and `formula: '20 + cnt * 8'` is consistent with the detailed field definitions and the `group_size_bytes: 8` for the repeated group. It is highly probable that 'cnt-8' in the PDF is a typographical error and should be interpreted as 'cnt * 8'.",
