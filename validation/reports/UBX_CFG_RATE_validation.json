The PDF also explicitly states 'Length (Bytes) = 6', while the canonical defines `payload.length.fixed: 0` but implies a length of 6 bytes from its fields (U2 + U2 + U2 = 6 bytes). This is a difference in representation rather than a functional mismatch.\n\nCrucially, the PDF indicates that this message is 'deprecated in protocol versions greater than 23.01', recommending `UBX-CFG-VALSET` / `VALGET` / `VALDEL` instead. The canonical `supported_versions` includes newer protocol versions (up to 3201), which contradicts the deprecation notice in the F9 HPG 1.51 manual. While not a structural discrepancy of the message *itself*, it's a significant functional and version-related note about its use.",
