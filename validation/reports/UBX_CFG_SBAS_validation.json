All fields: `mode` (X1), `usage` (X1), `maxSBAS` (U1), `scanmode2` (X1), and `scanmode1` (X4) are correctly represented with their respective byte offsets and sizes. The overall message class (0x06), ID (0x16), and fixed payload length (8 bytes) also match.\n\nThe PDF notes that this message is deprecated in protocol versions greater than 23.01, recommending UBX-CFG-VALSET/GET/DEL instead. The canonical `supported_versions` includes many protocol versions well above 2301 (e.g., 2740, 3201), indicating that while deprecated, it may still be documented for backward compatibility or specific product lines, which aligns with its presence in this manual for protocol version 27.40.",
