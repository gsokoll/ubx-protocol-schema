However, the PDF's detailed listing of fields within the 'Start of repeated block (numMeas times)' is severely incomplete. It only lists the first 4 bytes of what should be a 24-byte block (as per the overall length formula). The canonical definition's repeated group correctly accounts for all 24 bytes and includes additional expected fields (phaseOffset, phaseUnc, reserved3, freqOffset, freqUnc) that are crucial for the message's stated purpose of providing 'Frequency and/or phase measurement'. The canonical's scale of 0.00390625 for 2^-8 is correct for the listed fields. The PDF's reference 'Flags (see graphic below)' is ambiguous as the only graphic present is for a different message's flags (UBX-TIM-HOC). However, the canonical's bitfield definition for SMEAS flags (freqValid, phaseValid) is consistent with u-blox protocol specifications for this message. Given the consistency of the fixed header and the overall length formula, the canonical definition is considered accurate, and the PDF table is deemed incomplete.",
