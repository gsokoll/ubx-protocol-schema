The second (pages 3-4) applies to protocol versions 18-23.01 and has a 'version' of 0x0002. The canonical definition matches the second, more recent version (0x0002).\n\nMinor discrepancies exist in the naming of reserved fields; the canonical uses a sequential numbering starting from 0, while the PDF uses a sequential numbering starting from 1 for its first reserved field. The offsets, lengths, and reserved status are otherwise correct.\n\nFor 'aopCfg' (offset 27), the canonical uses data_type 'X1' while the PDF table uses 'U1'. However, the PDF includes a 'Bitfield aopCfg' graphic (page 5) that defines 'useAOP' at bit 0, confirming it is indeed a bitfield, making 'X1' the more appropriate data type in the canonical. This is considered an improvement in the canonical definition.\n\nFor 'useAdr' (offset 39), the PDF includes it as a 'U1' field and also shows 'adr' as bit 6 within 'mask2' (offset 4) in the 'Bitfield mask2' graphic. This is a common u-blox pattern where a bit in a mask field indicates whether a setting is applied, and a separate data field holds the value of that setting. The canonical's definition of 'useAdr' as a 'U1' field at offset 39 is consistent with this pattern and matches the field in the PDF's message structure table.",

For example, `mask1` has bits like `minMax`, `minCno`, `initial3dfix`, `wknRoll`, `ackAid`, `PPP`, and `aop`. `mask2` has bits like `adr` and `sigAttenComp`.\n\nSimilarly, for `aopCfg`, while the canonical lists it as `X1`, it lacks the explicit bitfield definition for `useAOP` (bit 0) as detailed in the PDF. The canonical's `X1` type for `aopCfg` is functionally appropriate given the PDF's bit definition.",
