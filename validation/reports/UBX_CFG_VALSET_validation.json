Therefore, this section is irrelevant for UBX-CFG-VALSET validation.\n\n2.  **Page 1 (bottom section):** '3.10.5.1 Set configuration item values' describes **UBX-CFG-VALSET version 0x00** (non-transactional). This version has fields 'version' (0x00), 'layers' (X1), followed by two implicit reserved bytes (bytes 2 and 3) before 'cfgData' at offset 4. The canonical definition targets UBX-CFG-VALSET version 0x01, which includes a 'transaction' field, making this a valid version difference.\n\n3.  **Page 2 (entire section):** '3.10.5.2 Set configuration item values (with transaction)' describes **UBX-CFG-VALSET version 0x01**. This is the version that the canonical definition matches very closely:\n    *   **version (U1, offset 0):** Matches. Both specify 'Message version (0x01 for this version)'.\n    *   **layers (X1, offset 1):** Matches. The PDF explicitly lists 'bit 0 U:1 ram', 'bit 1 U:1 bbr', and 'bit 2 U:1 flash' within this X1 field, which is consistent with the canonical's 'X1' type.\n    *   **transaction (X1, offset 2):** Matches in name and offset. The canonical correctly identifies it as 'X1'. The PDF lists it as 'U1' but then defines 'bits 1...0 U:2 action' within it, implicitly making it a bitfield. The canonical's 'X1' is more precise.\n    *   **reserved0 (U1, offset 3):** Matches. The canonical explicitly defines a 'reserved0' U1 field at offset 3. This is implicitly present in the PDF to align 'cfgData' at offset 4 after 'version', 'layers', and 'transaction' fields.\n    *   **cfgData (U1[], offset 4):** Matches conceptually.

However, section 3.10.25.2 provides an overview but *does not include a detailed payload table* for this transactional version. Therefore, direct field-by-field verification of fields specific to the transactional version (like the 'transaction' field) against an explicit PDF table is not possible. The canonical's structure *does not match* the detailed payload table provided for UBX-CFG-VALSET version 0x00 in section 3.10.25.1.",
