This is almost certainly a common u-blox manual typo. Based on the detailed field breakdown, the fixed part is 44 bytes, and each satellite measurement entry is 24 bytes. Thus, the correct variable payload length formula should be `44 + (numSV * 24)`, where `numSV` is a U1 field at byte offset 34.\n\n2.  **'flags' field**: At byte offset 35, the `flags` field (U1) is explicitly described as a bitfield: `bits 1...0 U:2 towSet`. A complete canonical definition should model this as an `X1` data type with a bitfield definition for `towSet`.\n\n3.  **Repeated Group**: The message contains a repeated group of satellite measurements, where each entry is 24 bytes long and the number of repetitions is determined by the `numSV` field (U1, offset 34).\n    -   The fields within each repeated group entry are: `gnssId` (U1, offset 0 within group), `svId` (U1, offset 1), `CNo` (U1, offset 2), `mpathIndic` (U1, offset 3), `dopplerMS` (I4, offset 4, scale 0.04 m/s), `dopplerHz` (I4, offset 8, scale 0.2 Hz), `wholeChips` (U2, offset 12), `fracChips` (U2, offset 14), `codePhase` (U4, offset 16, scale 2^-21 ms), `intCodePhase` (U1, offset 20, ms), `pseuRangeRMSErr` (U1, offset 21), and `reserved4` (U1[2], offset 22).\n\nAssuming the full canonical definition would incorporate these details correctly, the high-level match is confirmed.",
