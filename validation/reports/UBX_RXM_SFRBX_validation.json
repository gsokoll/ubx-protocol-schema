Protocol versions 18, 19, ..., 23.01 (Page 2):\n    - This structure largely aligns with the canonical definition for fields from offset 0 to 6.\n    - At offset 7: `reserved1` (canonical has `reserved0` - minor name difference for a reserved field).\n\nSince the canonical `min_protocol_version` is 1800, it should align with the structure on Page 2.\n\nThe most significant discrepancy is the handling of the 'data words' (dwrd). The canonical defines a single `U1` field named `dataWords` at byte offset 8. The PDF (both pages) explicitly states a 'Start of repeated block (numWords times)' where each block element is a `U4` named `dwrd` at '8 + 4*N'.

At byte offset 2, the canonical defines 'sigId' (Signal identifier) while the PDF clearly marks this byte as 'reserved1'. This changes the interpretation of the message content.\n2. The canonical payload defines 'dataWords' as a single U1 field at byte offset 8. However, the message is described as having a variable length based on 'numWords', with the PDF explicitly detailing a 'Start of repeated block (numWords times)' containing 'dwrd' of type U4. The canonical should use a 'repeated_groups' structure with U4 data type to correctly represent this part of the message.\n\nPage 1 of the PDF (older/different variant for M8, protocol 17) also differs at byte offset 5, where it shows 'reserved2' while the canonical matches page 2's 'chn' field. Since the canonical's 'min_protocol_version' is 1800, page 2 is the primary reference for this validation. The field 'reserved0' in canonical and 'reserved2'/'reserved3' in PDF for byte offset 7 are considered a match as they are both reserved fields of U1 type.",
