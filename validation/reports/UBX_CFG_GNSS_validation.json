Minor differences in field descriptions (e.g., more detailed notes in PDF regarding 'read only' for specific protocol versions) are not considered discrepancies as the core meaning is captured. The discrepancy in the payload length formula is very likely a typographical error in the PDF, as the canonical formula aligns with the explicit definition of a repeated group of 8-byte blocks.",
