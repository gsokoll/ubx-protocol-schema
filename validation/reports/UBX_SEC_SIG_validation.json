The fields on page 1 (3.17.2 UBX-SEC-SIG) appear to describe a different message variant or a different UBX-SEC-SIG message altogether, despite having the same message ID, as their payload structure is entirely different. This validation is based on the definition provided on page 2. All other fields and their bitfield definitions match perfectly between the canonical definition and the PDF for page 2. The formula discrepancy is highly likely a typo in the PDF, and the 'jammed' bit is a reasonable interpretation of the remaining bits in the X4 field, even if not explicitly broken down in the PDF table.",
