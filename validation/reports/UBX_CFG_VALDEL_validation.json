However, section '3.10.5.2 Delete configuration item values (with transaction)' explicitly refers to version 0 as a 'simplified version' of this message (version 1). The textual descriptions in section 3.10.5.2 strongly imply the functionality of a 'transaction' field, which is present in the canonical definition at offset 2, taking up one byte which was 'reserved' in version 0. The subsequent byte at offset 3 remains 'reserved' as per version 0. This common pattern of evolving UBX messages by re-purposing reserved bytes for new functionality, along with the explicit textual description of transaction support for version 1, indicates that the canonical definition correctly represents UBX-CFG-VALDEL version 1, even though the PDF does not provide a distinct message structure table for this version, instead only describing version 0 explicitly and version 1 implicitly through commentary.",

However, its payload structure (as shown in the table) still specifies `U1 version (0x00)` and `U1[2] reserved0` at offset 2, rather than an explicit `transaction` field (X1) and `version (0x01)` as defined in the canonical. The `layers` field definition (X1 at offset 1, with `bbr` and `flash` bits) matches between the canonical and PDF's transactional variant.
