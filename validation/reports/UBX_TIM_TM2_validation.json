The case for 'TOW' vs 'tow' in descriptions is a stylistic difference. The canonical's `payload.length.fixed` value is 0, but the sum of its fields (28 bytes) correctly matches the PDF's explicit length of 28 bytes. The `flags` field is correctly identified as an X1 (bitfield) type, which is elaborated upon in the PDF's 'Bitfield flags' section. The main discrepancy is the range of supported protocol versions, where the PDF indicates support from 15.x while the canonical starts at 18.00.",
