Fields named '...Flags' and typed as 'X1' are conventionally bitfields, meaning their individual bits represent distinct status flags. The canonical definition for this field is missing the 'bitfield_definition' key, making it incomplete. The provided PDF, which documents protocol version 22.01 (whereas the canonical is stated to be for protocol version 1800), clearly defines the bitfield for 'bdsLsFlags' on page 3. While the protocol versions differ, it is highly probable that the fundamental bitfield structure for a 'flags' field related to core GNSS status would remain consistent or very similar across these protocol versions. Therefore, the absence of this definition in the canonical for 1800 is considered an incompleteness that should be rectified using the most authoritative available information.",
