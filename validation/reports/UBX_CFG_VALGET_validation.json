If 'position' (U2) is at byte offset 2 in the request, it would occupy bytes 2 and 3. This conflicts directly with a 'reserved0' field being at byte offset 3. The canonical definition assumes 'layer' (U1) at offset 1 and 'position' (U2) at offset 2, which fully accounts for bytes 0-3 before the 'keys' repeated group starts at offset 4. Given the explicit 'mirrors' statement and the data type (U2) for 'position' in the response, the canonical's interpretation is more consistent and the 'reserved0' field in the PDF's request table is likely a manual error. For this reason, the confidence is high, but a discrepancy is noted due to the direct conflict in the manual's tables.",
